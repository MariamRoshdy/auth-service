# Authentication Service

## Architecture
[Diagram here]

## Features
- JWT Authentication (Access + Refresh tokens)
- Role-based authorization
- Clean Architecture / DDD
- Docker + PostgreSQL
- 80%+ test coverage
- API Gateway integration

## Tech Stack
- .NET 8
- EF Core
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- xUnit

## Running Locally
[Clear instructions]

## API Documentation
[Swagger/Postman collection]

## Design Decisions
[Why you chose certain approaches]
```

**Why:** First impression for hiring managers.

#### **8. Add Postman/Swagger Collection** (Half day)
Pre-built collection with all APIs and auth flow.

**Why:** Makes it easy for interviewers to test your code.

#### **9. Deploy to Cloud** (1-2 days)
Options (pick one):
- **Azure Container Apps** (easiest for .NET)
- **AWS ECS/Fargate**
- **Railway.app** (free tier)
- **Render.com** (free tier)

**Why:** Shows you can deploy, not just develop. Huge differentiator.

## **The Talking Points (Memorize These)**

When interviewer asks about your project, hit these points:

**Architecture:**
> "I built a microservices architecture with separate auth and resource services. Used Clean Architecture principles with clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers."

**Security:**
> "Implemented JWT-based authentication with access and refresh token rotation. Tokens are signed with HMAC-SHA256, and I validate issuer, audience, and expiration on every request."

**Testing:**
> "Wrote unit tests for business logic using Moq and xUnit, plus integration tests using Testcontainers to spin up real PostgreSQL instances. Currently at 80% coverage."

**DevOps:**
> "Fully containerized with Docker, using multi-stage builds for optimization. Wrote shell scripts for automated migrations. Deployed to Azure Container Apps with CI/CD via GitHub Actions."

**Scalability:**
> "Services communicate via REST with an API Gateway for routing. Each service has its own database following the database-per-service pattern. Easy to scale horizontally."

## **Common Interview Questions You'll Ace**

✅ "How do you handle authentication in microservices?"  
✅ "What's the difference between authentication and authorization?"  
✅ "How do you secure JWT tokens?"  
✅ "Explain your project architecture"  
✅ "How do you test your code?"  
✅ "What's Clean Architecture?"  
✅ "How do you handle errors in your API?"  
✅ "How would you scale this system?"  
✅ "What databases have you worked with?"  
✅ "Describe your Docker experience"

## **Priority Order (If Time-Constrained)**

**Must Have (Week 1):**
1. Clean Architecture refactor
2. Unit tests (even just 5-10 key tests)
3. One resource service
4. Good README

**Should Have (Week 2):**
5. API Gateway
6. Integration tests
7. Logging
8. Exception handling

**Nice to Have (Week 3):**
9. Cloud deployment
10. CI/CD pipeline
11. Monitoring dashboard

## **Red Flags to Avoid**

❌ Hardcoded secrets in code  
❌ No error handling  
❌ No logging  
❌ Messy code structure  
❌ No README  
❌ Can't run the project easily  
❌ No tests at all

## **Your 30-Second Pitch**

> "I built a production-ready microservices system with authentication and authorization. It uses JWT tokens, follows Clean Architecture, has 80% test coverage, runs in Docker containers, and is deployed to Azure. I can show you the live demo right now."

## **Job Application Strategy**

**LinkedIn Profile:**
- Add "Microservices | .NET | Docker | JWT Authentication" to headline
- Add project link to featured section
- Post about what you're building (algorithm boost)

**Resume:**
```
Software Engineer Project:
- Built authentication microservice handling JWT-based auth with 
  access/refresh tokens
- Implemented Clean Architecture with 80% test coverage
- Dockerized services with PostgreSQL and API Gateway
- Deployed to Azure Container Apps with CI/CD pipeline
- Tech: .NET 8, EF Core, Docker, PostgreSQL, xUnit
